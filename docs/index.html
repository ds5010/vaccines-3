          <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Methodology</p>
          <p>To assess the effectiveness of the vaccination over time, the % of the vaccinated population over 18 years
            of age (CDC) was compared to Covid related deaths per 100k (JHU). The data was broken down by U.S. region
            (West, Midwest, South, Northeast) based on the <a
              href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf">Center For Census Bureau
              regional divisions</a>, and a snapshot was of data was taken at the end of each month to create a more
            accurate representation. Because the JHU cumulates deaths, the time series was adjusted to compute the
            difference in death figures between dates. </p>
		  <p>Due to changes in reporting measures, starting in June 2022, rather than reflecting the last day of the month, 
			the data reflects the last Wednesday of the month.</p>

          <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Methodology</p>
          <p>Similarly to the National View, this analysis is comparing the number of deaths and vaccination percentages
            over the same time period. However, the visualization shows a county-level comparison between Kent County,
            RI and Tuscaloosa County, AL.</p>
          <p>The original team selected Kent County and Tuscaloosa County due to their similar population demographics, but
            highly different rates of vaccination to see the impact (if any) on death rates due to COVID-19. The same
            JHU and CDC data sources were used.</p>

            <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Contextual Analysis</p>
            <p> Further research explains some of the trends we can see in the above charts. </p>
			<p>When reviewing the National View, we believe that the large shift in vaccination rates seen throughout the country in the summer of 2021 can 
			be explained by vaccines only becoming publicly available in May of 2021. We also believe that the spikes in deaths shown in both the National and County 
			view in the fall of 2021 are a result of the delta variant.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, it appears that smaller localities tend to have the highest rates of deaths per 100k, a disparity which grows more prominent
			as time passes, even if or even as vaccination rates have increased. Other research corroborates that rural residents are normally more vulnerable to 
			death from COVID-19 due to factors that include underlying health conditions, older age, and lack of health insurance.</p>
        	<p>As for the County View, we were able to look back at public records and theorize that the confounding variable of political alignment 
			for Rhode Island and Alabama (with the prevailing theory that Democrat-run states took a more cautious/careful approach to Covid compared to 
			Republican-run states) had little to no effect. We are able to say this because while Alabama did remove their stay at home order first 
			(with their “safer at home policy” being discontinued in late March 2021), Rhode Island was not far behind with their high risk Covid activities 
			being allowed again in July 2021. </p>
			<p>Additionally, it is evident that there is a flattening out of the deaths per 100k in both locations, starting in 
			about March 2022. Some of this is likely attributable to the completion of a 'winter spike', but it is also possible that the spread of the 
			omicron BA.2 subvariant, which became the dominant strain in the US around that time, had its part to play. After all, omicron and its subvariants, 
			while more transmissible, normally caused less severe illness and would therefore contribute to fewer deaths as compared to delta, the prior variant of concern.</p>

            <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Repository Changes</p>
            <p>The major changes used to update the visualizations came from expanding the timeframe to stretch beyond the 
				original six months used by the Spring 2022 DS5010 class and come to current day, which means that the visualizations
				span the timeframe of May 2021 to January 2023. In the process of updating the timeframe, we also made changes to the visualization,
				by mapping the comparison with seaborn rather than with matplotlib and by ensuring that the gif was in chronological order.</p>
			<p>We also updated this webpage and README.md to account for the changes that we've made.</p>
            <p>However, the Spring 2023 DS5010 class made additional changes, including reduced hard-coding, code simplification, and deleting some
				extra files. We also added a .yml file and addressed compatibility issues caused by updates to packages, although a fuller history of what we
				identified and addressed as issues can be found at the <a
